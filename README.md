# Project Title

## Overview
This project implements a reinforcement learning agent using a deep neural network to make decisions based on a state representation. The agent learns to optimize its actions to maximize cumulative rewards in a given environment.

## Features
- Neural network model based on PyTorch
- Action selection using epsilon-greedy strategy
- Experience replay buffer for training stability
- Dynamic updating of target model
- Supports GPU acceleration

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To train the model, execute the following command:
```bash
python train.py
```
You can modify the training parameters in the `train.py` file as needed.

## Model Architecture
The `MyModel` class defines the neural network structure. It consists of:
- An input layer that flattens the input state
- Multiple hidden layers (configurable)
- An output layer representing the action space

### Input/Output Dimensions
- Inputs: A tensor of shape (deep, height, width)
- Outputs: A tensor representing the action values

## Training Process
The agent is trained using the Q-learning algorithm:
1. Collect experiences in a replay buffer.
2. Sample a batch of experiences for training.
3. Update the model using the loss between predicted and target Q-values.
4. Adjust epsilon for exploration-exploitation balance.

## Hyperparameters
The following hyperparameters can be configured:
- `learning_rate`: Initial learning rate for the optimizer
- `epsilon`: Exploration rate for action selection
- `epsilon_decay`: Decay factor for epsilon
- `gamma`: Discount factor for future rewards
- `batch_size`: Number of experiences sampled for each training step
- `target_update`: Frequency of target model updates
